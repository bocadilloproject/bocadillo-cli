# Contributing guidelines

Welcome! We're glad to see you here. This document will get you up and running with Bocadillo CLI development.

## Getting started

After forking and cloning the repo, install the CLI locally using:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll then have an editable version of the `bocadillo` command available locally. You can make changes to the `bocadillo_cli` package and they will be reflected right away.

## Proposing changes

If you've found a bug, have a feature request, or would like to contribute documentation, here's what you can do to have your change merged in:

- (Recommended) If the problem is non-trivial, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo-cli/issues/new) to discuss it with maintainers.
- Work on a separate branch, and make sure tests pass before pushing them to the remote.
- [Open a pull request](https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo-cli/compare) with your changes.
